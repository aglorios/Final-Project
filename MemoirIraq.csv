Here is a history of the war in Iraq as told entirely by Iraqis living through the U.S. invasion and occupation. Beginning in 2003, this intimate narrative includes the experiential accounts of civilians, politicians, former dissidents, insurgents, and militiamen. Iraqis offering firsthand stories range from onetime Prime Minister Ayad Allawi to resistance fighters speaking on the condition of anonymity. Divided into five parts, these interviews recount the 2003 invasion; Iraq's gradual slide into chaos from 2004 to 2005; the start of a new order in 2006; the rise of open sectarian violence over the next two years; and the effort since 2008 to reconstruct a society from relative calm. Each section includes interviews grouped into themes, with brief epilogues for the participants. Not since Studs Terkel's The Good War has a book captured so acutely the human consequences of a conflict we are still struggling to understand. Voices from Iraq makes utterly vivid the meaning and legacy of America's campaign in Iraq.""Voices from Iraq : a people's history, 2003-2009 00 /","Kukis, Mark,","New York : Columbia University Press, 2011"War Heroes/Battle Heroes : Voices from Iraq & Afghanistan /,"Zullo, Allan.","New York : Scholastic, 2009"Historia Jessiki Lynch : ja tez jestem zolnierzem /,"Bragg, Rick.; Zukowska-Maziarska, Anna.","Warszawa : Dom Wydawniczy Bellona, 2004""I am a soldier, too : the Jessica Lynch story /","Bragg, Rick.","Waterville, ME : Thorndike Press,  2004, 2003"War Heroes/Battle Heroes : Voices from Iraq & Afghanistan /,"Zullo, Allan.","New York : Scholastic, 2009"Historia Jessiki Lynch : ja tez jestem zolnierzem /,"Bragg, Rick.; Zukowska-Maziarska, Anna.","Warszawa : Dom Wydawniczy Bellona, 2004""I am a soldier, too : the Jessica Lynch story /","Bragg, Rick.","Waterville, ME : Thorndike Press,  2004, 2003"Angel walk : nurses at war in Iraq and Afghanistan /,"Richie-Melvan, Sharon I.; Vines, Diane.","Portland, Or. : Arnica Pub., 2010"My life in war : did we ever really leave /,"Apel, Joshua.","[S.l. : s.n.], 2010"A hundred and one days : a Baghdad journal.,"Seierstad, sne, 1970-","Waterville, Me. : Wheeler/BBC Audiobooks, 2005"HOGs in the shadows : combat stories from Marine snipers in Iraq /,"Afong, Milo S.","New York : Berkley Caliber, 2007"Freedom express : caught between Iraq and a hard place : a war journal /,"Allen, David, Colonel.","Marietta, GA : Deeds Pub., 2008"Fear up harsh : an Army interrogator's dark journey through Iraq,"Lagouranis, Tony; Mikaelian, Allen","New York, NY NAL Caliber 2007"The long walk a story of war and the life that follows /,"Castner, Brian.","Thorndike, Me. : Center Point Large Print, 2012"Running the Gauntlet : the private war in Iraq /,"Duffy, Luke.","Bloomington, Ind. : Authorhouse, 2011"Road from Ar Ramadi : the private rebellion of Staff Sergeant Camilo Mejia /,"Meja, Camilo.","New York [u.a.] : New Press, 2007"One bullet away the making of a Marine Officer /,"Fick, Nathaniel.","London : Phoenix,  2005, 2005"Losing small wars : British military failure in Iraq and Afghanistan /,"Ledwidge, Frank.","New Haven, CT : Yale University Press, 2011"Highway to hell : dispatches from a mercenary in Iraq /,"Geddes, John.","New York : Broadway Books, 2008"Losing small wars : British military failure in Iraq and Afghanistan /,"Ledwidge, Frank.","New Haven, Conn ; London : Yale University Press,  2012, 1220"Losing small wars : British military failure in Iraq and Afghanistan /,"Ledwidge, Frank.","New Haven, Conn.
